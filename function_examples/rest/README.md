# REST with Functions

Here's an example of using a [third party REST resource](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) by doing the REST calls on the backend using Netlify Functions.

This example is minimal so you can quickly and easily get started with Functions. You may notice that this example does not provide code or configuration to set up a local development environment. That's fine, it is not intended to be realistic, just to get you going fast.

To see the demo site, you can clone this repo and deploy the example to Netlify following our [documentation](https://www.netlify.com/docs/#getting-started).
